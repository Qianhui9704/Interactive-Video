# Online Jigsaw Learning using Interactive Video
## 1. Anticipated Learner Behavior 
First of all, learners have shared learning goal, which is to understand how the violin works, in terms of how to change the amplitude, pitch and timber. Their common goal also includes getting as high as possible in the final test. 
Second, our instructional video follows jigsaw instruction (without discussing in expert group though) in that learners are in charge of different parts of learning. Learner A needs to master how to change the pitch of the sound while learner B are going to learner amplitude and timbre of the sound. Both learner are going to teach each other their own parts in an instruction section.

## 2. Anticipated Failures
(1) Watch the common part of the instructiona video first.
(2) Select the topic they would like to learn more and watch the corresponding part of video.
(3) Do the formative assessment, retry until they get them all correct.
(4) Teach each other 
(5) Do the final exam independently and receive a score

The most anticipated failure is that students fail to master their own parts, in other words, they fail to become a subject matter of expertise in their own field. Also, the lecturing section could potentially be unproductive as a result of students'failure to convery all the information they know even if they know it themselves. 

## 3. How the tool supports scaffold for positive interdependence and create incentives for individual accountability.
For positive interdependence, each learner is learning only one part. The only way that they are going to learn all the contents is to rely on the partner. We created formative tests to check the learner's own understanding of knowledge first before allowing him or her to teach their peer. We also provided elaborative feedback to correct students' misunderstandings.

For individual accountability, both learners are going to take the same quiz together. Their score will be an average of scores from both learners. Therefore, helping the other person learn is to the maximum of their own interest as well. 

## User Testing 
Some UI problems: 
1. The radio buttons are not aligned, which adds unnecessary cognitive load to people. 
2. Several technical bugs occur when people try to click through the questions.
3. Add clear affordance of which section we are in (i.e. formative assessment, summative assessment) to give learners a clear idea where they are in the learning process.

Problems regarding instruction:
    1. The length of video is not balanced. The common part (intro + pitch) is too long (2:30 min), while each individual’s video part is too short (30s). Learners totally have reason to walk through the video without relying on each other since it isn’t too much work. Therefore, the motivation for positive interdependence is not so strong. Also, learners don’t remember what is in their unique part because the common part is too long. Therefore, they are not clear as to what they should teach their counterpart. 
    2. We should also show successful feedback, because even if the learners answer it correctly, there is a possibility that they are just guessing it right. 
    3. It is better that we make a short summary at the end.
