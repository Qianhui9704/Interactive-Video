1. How learners would cooperate and their anticipated behavior and failures
First of all, learners have shared learning goal, which is to understand how the violin works, in terms of how to change the amplitude, pitch and timber. Their goal includes getting as high as possible in the final test. 
Second, our instructional video follows jigsaw instruction in that learners are in charge of different parts of learning. Learner A needs to master how to change the amplitude of the sound while learner B are going to change the pitch of the sound. Both learner are going to teach each other their own parts in an instruction section.

The most anticipated failure is that students fail to master their own parts, in other words, they fail to become a subject matter of expertise in their own field. 

2. How the tool supports scaffold for positive interdependence and create incentives for individual accountability.
For positive interdependence, the only way that they are going to learn all the contents is to rely on the partner. For individual accountability, both learners are going to take the same quiz together. An extrinsic way to create individual accountability is to check the learner's own understanding of knowledge first before allowing him or her to teach their peer.


3. What was reused from project 1 and all the changes both in instruction and in technical design. 

The same:
The video didn't change. We removed the think-then-tell design in it because we are not really planning a discovery learning. We used some questions from A1 as well. 

The changes:
(1) We included emphasis of misconceptions in the instruction video
This is a design we learnt from Coursera, which includes a pop-up window saying "how many students learning this are not doing it correctly."

(2)Included formative and summative assessments
Formative assessments are given for individual students to self-check their mastery level before they teach their peer. In formative assessment, we give them 

(3) Added elaborative feedback at the end to include an explanation and not just correctness. We gave suggestions to readers as to which part of the video should be reviewed instead of giving them a general reminder to review the whole video. 

The limitation of re-using instructional material 
(1) The amount of video divided between 2 students could be more equal
Because the 1st video we created was not designed in purpose for students to do collaborative learning, the content was not intentionally equally divided between learners. Should we want to implement jigsaw learning, we should enrich the type of learning. 
(2) The questions need to be re-designed to specially address different parts of learning
For example, the questions regarding amplitude and timber should be more targeted at the specific instructional video.
