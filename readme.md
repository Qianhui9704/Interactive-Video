1. How learners would cooperate and their anticipated behavior and failures
First of all, learners have shared learning goal, which is to understand how the violin works, in terms of how to change the amplitude, pitch and timber. Their common goal also includes getting as high as possible in the final test. 
Second, our instructional video follows jigsaw instruction (without discussing in expert group though) in that learners are in charge of different parts of learning. Learner A needs to master how to change the pitch of the sound while learner B are going to learner amplitude and timbre of the sound. Both learner are going to teach each other their own parts in an instruction section.

We anticipated that learners would follow the instructional sequence that we designed, 
(1) Watch the common part of the instructiona video first.
(2) Select the topic they would like to learn more and watch the corresponding part of video.
(3) Do the formative assessment, retry until they get them all correct.
(4) Teach each other 
(5) Do the final exam independently and receive a score

The most anticipated failure is that students fail to master their own parts, in other words, they fail to become a subject matter of expertise in their own field. Also, the lecturing section could potentially be unproductive as a result of students'failure to convery all the information they know even if they know it themselves. 

2. How the tool supports scaffold for positive interdependence and create incentives for individual accountability.
For positive interdependence, each learner is learning only one part. The only way that they are going to learn all the contents is to rely on the partner. We created formative tests to check the learner's own understanding of knowledge first before allowing him or her to teach their peer. We also provided elaborative feedback to correct students' misunderstandings.

For individual accountability, both learners are going to take the same quiz together. Their score will be an average of scores from both learners. Therefore, helping the other person learn is to the maximum of their own interest as well. 


3. What was reused from project 1 and all the changes both in instruction and in technical design. 

The same:
The video didn't change. We removed the think-then-tell design in it because we are not really planning a discovery learning. We used some questions from A1 as well. 

The changes:

(1)Included formative and summative assessments
Formative assessments are given for individual students to self-check their mastery level before they teach their peer. In formative assessment, we give them elaborative feedback to both correct and incorrect answers.

(2) Added elaborative feedback at the end to include an explanation and not just correctness. We gave suggestions to readers as to which part of the video should be reviewed instead of giving them a general reminder to review the whole video. 

The limitation of re-using instructional material 
(1) The amount of video divided between 2 students could be more equal
Because the 1st video we created was not designed in purpose for students to do collaborative learning, the content was not intentionally equally divided between learners. Should we want to implement jigsaw learning, we should enrich the type of learning. 
(2) The questions need to be re-designed to specially address different parts of learning
For example, the questions regarding amplitude and timber should be more targeted at the specific instructional video. Therefore, the questions we designed for A1 should be redesigned. 


4. 1st testing summary 
Anticipated behavior: 
We anticipated that learners would follow the instructional sequence that we designed, 
(1) Watch the common part of the instructiona video first.
(2) Select the topic they would like to learn more and watch the corresponding part of video.
(3) Do the formative assessment, retry until they get them all correct.
(4) Teach each other 
(5) Do the final exam independently and receive a score

Actual behavior:
Learners follow (1)(2)(3)(5) mostly as expected, several problems arise that worth noticing include:
(1) When discussing with each other, as the common part is too long. Learners tend to forget which one is in the common part and which are in their own part.
(2) Learners understand the meaning but was tricked by the choice of f


5. 2nd testing summary



Some UI problems: 
1. The radio buttons are not aligned, which adds unnecessary cognitive load to people. 
2. Several technical bugs occur when people try to click through the questions.
3. Add clear affordance of which section we are in (i.e. formative assessment, summative assessment) to give learners a clear idea where they are in the learning process.

Problems regarding instruction:
    1. The length of video is not balanced. The common part (intro + pitch) is too long (2:30 min), while each individual’s video part is too short (30s). Learners totally have reason to walk through the video without relying on each other since it isn’t too much work. Therefore, the motivation for positive interdependence is not so strong. Also, learners don’t remember what is in their unique part because the common part is too long. Therefore, they are not clear as to what they should teach their counterpart. 
    2. We should also show successful feedback, because even if the learners answer it correctly, there is a possibility that they are just guessing it right. 
    3. It is better that we make a short summary at the end. 

Anticipated behavior:
We anticipated that learners would follow the instructional sequence that we designed, 
(1) Watch the common part of the instructiona video first.
(2) Select the topic they would like to learn more and watch the corresponding part of video.
(3) Do the formative assessment, retry until they get them all correct.
(4) Teach each other 
(5) Do the final exam independently and receive a score

Actual behavior:
(1) Watch the common part of the instructiona video first.
(2) Select the topic they would like to learn more and watch the corresponding part of video.
(3) Do the formative assessment, retry until they get them all correct.
(4) Teach each other 
(5) Do the final exam independently and receive a score
(6) Raised a couple of questions in terms of the response answers!

The actual behavior and anticipated behavior is quite similar in almost all regards.
Difference: Still tricke by some word choice, like "amplitude"
  A multiple choice question raised controversy because of the phrasing.
